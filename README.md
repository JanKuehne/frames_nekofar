Farcaster Frames Template is an easy-to-use template designed for beginners and experienced developers alike. It provides a robust starting point for building Farcaster Frames, streamlining the development process. This template is ideal for those looking to create custom frames quickly and efficiently.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (Version 18 or later)
A text editor like VSCode
Basic understanding of TypeScript and Node.js
Use Template
You can use this repository as a template to create a new GitHub repository with the same directory structure and files. Here's how:

On the repository page, click the Use this template button.
Choose the owner of the new repository and enter a repository name.
Optionally, add a description for your repository.
Choose the repository visibility (Public or Private).
Click Create repository to create your new repository from template.
After creating your repository from this template, clone it and install the dependencies.

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourname/farcaster-frames-template.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd farcaster-frames-template
Install the dependencies:
pnpm install
Start the development server:
pnpm run dev
Usage Guide
The template uses Localtunnel which allows you to easily test your frames without the need to deploy them. Everytime running your project, you will receive a random URL, for example https://thirty-glasses-tell.loca.lt. You can directly copy this URL and test your frame using the Warpcast Embed Tools. This makes the development and testing process much more efficient and straightforward.
